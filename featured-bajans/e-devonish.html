        This summary was lovingly submitted by her her Nephew Melvin, Jean and Patrick.

        <br><br>
        Born June 13, 1919 in Redman's Village, Eglantine went to school at Redman's Village Primary School. She is the second of three siblings of Joseph and Sarah Devonish. "Aunt", as she is better known among relatives and close friends, is a family-oriented person. Her first passion was cooking, and boy could she make a mellow cou-cou - no matter the sauce, and delicious fish cakes.
        <br><br>
        While living in Barbados she worked at Prior Park Plantation as a cook, where she perfected her culinary skills. While I was attending high school I remember "Aunt" sharing her meager weekly salary with my sister Judy and me.  "Aunt " migrated to the U.S. In 1965 where she lived with her brother.
        <br><br>
        Her second passion was her love for her brother Joseph which she called by his middle name " Elman".  While he and his wife Catherine were working, "Aunt" took up duties of cooking for the family and the revolving door of guests, family and friendly visitors.
        <br><br>
        Aunt's hobby was Arts and Crafts. Many households in New York are adorned with doilies, sofa cushions, napkin holders, and toilet paper holders made from beaded cloth, hot glue and string. Her other hobbies are solving biblical puzzles, and challenging family and friends to Bible verses If she questioned you about a verse and you couldn't answer she would say, "You are as dumb as a wet biscuit!"  Aunt had some interesting sayings. If you complained about missing a bus or train, she would ask, "What were flies doing before dog ear cut?"
        <br><br>
        "Aunt" has one son, Michael and six grand children.  She is very strong-willed.  When her mind is made up, don't even try to convince her to change, it's not happening.But she is just as loving, with an infectious smile, and when she laughs, she says, " You make me laugh like I living!"
        <br><br>
        Eglantine Asenath Devonish has been a continuing member of the Coalition for the Barbados Association of Central Florida since moving here nearly twenty years ago.
