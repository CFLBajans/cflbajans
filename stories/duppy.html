        Muh dear Bruddas & Sistas:
        <br>
        It is yuh friend Doris writing to let wunnah know dat I manage to tek de lil trip home fuh Crop Over. Muh friend, Obe went too and we meet up wid Patsy and a few more friends from way over yonda, so we had a real good time. But Obe had a lil set back while she was dere but I heard everything alright now.
        <br>
        One day Patsy took a whole bunch o'we down to St. Lucy to spend de day wid dis woman she had to call aunt. De car dat drop we down dere was not coming back till night, so after dinner we decided to walk round de districk. We shopped and talked to Lilian, Padmore, Carmen and a whole heap of people we didn't see fuh a long time.
        <br>
        Outside was just turning dusk when we got to St. Lucy Church. Next ting I know Patsy sih "Doan look round now, but I tink I see three men sitting pon de soft stone next to de church wall, en duh look like duppies". I peep through de corners of muh eyes but I cunn see nuffin.
        <br>
        "Patsy, why you doan stop mekking sport doah and see lil children here?" But dis time Patsy real serious, I could tell when I see how she set up she face. "Doris, I nevva tell you dis, but you XX know I born with de lining cross muh face, so I does see spirits. Shush! Shush one of dem jest get up and he heading dis way."
        <br>
        We take off down de road like racehorses. Every now and den we check wid Patsy. "Patsy he still coming?". "Yes, keep running", she holler.
        <br>
        Man, dah duppy run we clear down to Checker Hall, before Patsy tell we he turned back. I doan have to tell wunnah, we mek dat trip back to Patsy aunt in no time at all.
        <br>
        But yuh know later dat night, Obe tek sick. She had a roasting high fever and we had to rush she to Queen Elizabeth. And, I cocksure dat it is de fright she had dat day dat drop she constitution and bring on dat sickness.
        <br>
        I tell yuh someting, dah really brings to mind dat we can be here today and gone tomorrow. And seeing dat we not as young as we used to be, we must be careful.
